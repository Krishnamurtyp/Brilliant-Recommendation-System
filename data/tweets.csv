Inarritu joins John Ford and Joe Mankiewicz as the only directors to win back to back Oscars. But no one has won back to back 4 Best Picture
"Oscar ends its 3 hour and 36 minute show with ""Fight the Power."" I'm assuming that's meant for people of color. A long road ahead."
"Much to my joy, Spotlight triumphs over The Revenant for Best Picture. It was a ragged, slog of a show. But the right movie won. Yes!"
"Leo wins, at last. No surprise. But the fire and intelligence of his acceptance speech, that nailed it."
Brie Larson wins Best Actress for Room. The award was expected by so well and truly earned.
"Alejandro Inarritu wins directing Oscar twice in a row. His articulate speech, one of the few worthy of remembering, is cut off w music!"
The great Ennio Morricone wins his first scoring Oscar for The Hateful Eight. Talk about what took you so long. Genius.
"Sam Smith's meh song from Spectre beats Gaga's anthem from The Hunting Groubd. Wait, what? Are you kidding?"
"intro'd byJoe Biden, Lady Gaga delivers a passionate version of ""Till It Happens to You"" with backup from other rape survivors. Bravo."
Amy wins Best Documentary and deserves it.
Thanks Louis CK for being funny and pointed in introducing Documentary Short Subject.
Night's biggest shocker. Mark Rylance beats Stallone for Best Supporting Actor. You could complain. Would it help? A gracious speech.
Chris Rock's visit to a Compton multiplex is so funny it hurts. No one's heard of any of the nominated movies.
Inside-Out deserves its Animated Oscar. But so did Anomalisa. Sorry.
Passed out for a minute and saw Chris Rock selling Girl Scout cookies and all the Oscar presenters turned animated.
"Room  star Jacob Tremblay,9, looked excited to see the Star Wars robots on the Oscar stage. At least someone looked alive.Dull is sinking in"
"Nice moment seeing Margaret Sixel winning Best Editing for her husband George Miller's Mad Max.
Also supremely well deserved."
Three Oscars in a row for Lubezki. Chivo makes history with The Revenant.
"""And the should have been nominated Michael B Jordan."" Great intro from Chris Rock"
Three technical Oscars in s row for the great Mad Max Fury Road and yet it has no chance for Best Picture and director George Miller. Stupid
Alicia Vikander wins Supporting Actress Oscar for Danish Girl and actually kisses boyfriend Michael Fassbender in public.
Spotlight and Big Short win Screenplay Oscars. Will they be the last awards these 2 great films win?
"Great Chris Rock line at Oscars: ""In Memorium tribute will be just black people shot by cops on the way to the movies."
RT @KermitTheFrog: Some interviewers really are more fun. Thanks for having me @petertravers and @PopcornABCNews!  https://t.co/ZoVd3bRC6P
Some interviews really are more fun. https://t.co/TpRpJU9dZM https://t.co/l1xCK6NMGN
"Great to meet Cube, terrific guest! https://t.co/uQE8RO2o9x"
The Revenant grabs surprise win as Best Drama and might change the Oscar chances of Spotlight if the Globes meant a damn thing. They don't.
Leo DiCaprio wins Globe for Actor Drama and the audience applause should carry him home to Oscar. Very nice speech.
Brie Larson proves a popular choice as Best Actress for Room. No argument here.
"Did I just seeTarantino chatting with Cate Blanchett whose movies he recently ridiculed? Well, I'll be."
"2-time Globe winner Jim Carrey gives Comedy prize to The Martian, not a comedy at all. Big Short suffers a slight setback on road to Oscar."
"Jennifer Lawrence was good in Joy, but Amy Schumer and Lily Tomlin deserved the Globe more. Sorry, haters:"
Taraji P. Henson wins her Globe as the immortal Cookie Lyon in Empire. And hands out cookies. Good one.
"Morgan Freeman gives Director Globe to Alejandro G. Inarritu  for The Revenant. George Miller and Ridley Scott, I personally salute you."
"Tom Hanks gives great intro for Denzel Washington, the winner of DeMille award. Never seen Denzel that shaken."
Mr. Robot wins Best Drama Globe. Me? I couldn't be happier. The shoutout to Rami Malek so deserved.
"Katy Perry gives Globe for Best Song to Sam Smith for Writing's On the Wall"" from Spectre. A surprise given the song's meh reviews."
"Lady Gaga wins acting Globe for American Horror Story. A genuine, heartfelt speech, but Queen Latifah got robbed for Bessie."

"Gael Garcia Bernal wins Globe for Mozart in the Jungle. Again, the Globes honor new work. Congrats."
"Screenplay Globe goes, as it should, to Aaron Sorkin for Steve Jobs. A movie that I thought was forgotten."
"Stallone gets his expected Globe for Creed and thanks everyone but the film's true talent, director Ryan Coogler. Wait, what!"
Kurt Russell and step-daughter Kate Hudson give Inside-Out its deserved Globe for animation.
Matt Damon wins Best Actor Comedy for The Martian. Fill in your own joke.
Besties Amy Schumer and Jennifer Lawrence present their own movies. I'm thinking Amy's remarks cut by the censors must have been funny.
"Jon Hamm gets the Globe for last season of Mad Men. Ok, I guess. But Rami Malek  of Mr. Robot gets my vote."
Quentin Tarantino accepts composer award for the great Ennio Morricone for Hateful Eight.
ChristianSlater wins Globe for the terrific Mr. Robot. Alright!
Oscar Isaac wins Globe for Show Me a Hero. No mention of being in Star Wars.
Wolf Hall beats Fargo for the Globe. Bad call. Fargo is the Greatest!
"Gervais intros Matt Damon as ""the only person Ben Affleck hasn't been unfaithful to."" Good one."
Gotta hand it to the Globes for their TV https://t.co/YPggeMXisK stuff like Rachel Bloom and Mozart in the Jungle!
Maura Tierney also a surprise winner for The Affair. But how damn good she was this season.
"Kate Winslet wins Golden Globe for Steve Jobs. She ""extremely surprised,"" as are we all. Pleasantly."
"Should win Golden Globes: Spotlight, Big Short, Schumer, Saoirse Ronan, Damon,Fassbender, Paul Dano, Vikander, George Miller. Which won't?"

Party time here. Julianne Moore wins as expected. Redmayne beats Keaton. Ouch. Birdman beats Boyhood. Super Ouch! But that's Hollywood!
Affleck gives Best Director Oscar that he wasn't nominated for Argo to Inarritu for Birdman. The die is cast.
"""Stay weird. Stay different"" becomes the unofficial mantra of OSCAR  2015. Thanks Graham Moore."
Oprah gives Adapted Screenplay to Imitation Game. Graham Moore talks of wanting to kill himself at 16. His heartfelt speech honors the film.
"Eddie Murphy gives Original Screenplay to Birdman. Smart money was on Budapest. But after Gaga, all bets are off. Is Wes clapping?"
I'm sorry. The segment with Lady Gaga channeling a nun with ink sent me into feeling like I'm in the Twilight Zone. Was that Julie Andrews?
Nice comic touch that Travolta  and Idina Menzel present the Best Song OSCAR.
Ironic. the Best Song winner honors a great movie with impassioned words from Common and John Legend that honor the power of music &amp; film
Note to NPH: the correct way to say the last name of Selma star David Oyelowo is Oh Yellow Oh
Citizen4 takes Doc as Laura Poitras commends Snowden and Glen Greenwald for speaking g truth to power. Many in the glam crowd look confused.
Whiplash wins again. This time for editing. Is a surprise developing?
"Meryl Streep intros In Memoriam segment, clearly missing many colleagues, especially the great Mike Nichols. http://t.co/pqfsmcvj3R"
"Birdman, remember that movie, wins for Cinematography. All hail, Chivo. A great artist."
"Big Hero 6 was fun, but Dragon 2 hit me harder."
Wow! The Academy remembered Interstellar came out this year! Great fx
Rita Ora is on and off so fast it's like her song was a Best Picture nominee!
Deserved winner Patricia Arquette gives speech of the night about gender equality. Streep and JLo clearly agree. http://t.co/TsCrEeCG1F
"Low point of the night, I hope: NPH jokes about the dress of a woman who has just spoken movingly of her son's suicide."
"NPH mispronounces David Oyelowo but gets off a good one:""So now you like him""!"
Viola Davis's transformation into a Hollywood glamorpuss is kind of wonderful.
The two at a time bunching of Best Pictures nominees is a disgrace.
Ida wins Foreign Film prize for its simplicity in a world of glitz. It's Polish director fights being played off. Good for you Pawel.
JK Simmons. Class act. Always. http://t.co/zq10WVimPM
Cumberbatch expressing all our sentiments http://t.co/QK1WEmVhXH
"""The best and the whitest.""

Survived OSCAR red carpet which seemed more dutiful and less ridiculous than usual. Uh-oh! Are we headed for 4 hours of drag-ass dullness?
True dat RT @RedHourBen: Just watched an incredibly affecting and moving documentary  #Virunga. See it if you can. http://t.co/TgAHOubMPz
"Amen to that, Judy! RT @judyblume: @petertravers - I'd give Birdman multiple Oscars."
"Gave Michael a Keaton a mini Birdman award on my ABC show, but who thinks he's got a full-sized OSCAR locked up? http://t.co/INLqDdda4z"
Amen!RT @AVAETC: All my love to #DavidOyelowo. Your performance as King is EXTRAORDINARY. You're a miracle in my life. Thx for choosing me:
"Best Golden Globe speeches? Keaton, Arquette, Linklater. OSCAR here they come."
"Meryl hands Best Drama to Boyhood. All is well with the world. But the show is way 2 respectable. For dull, we have the Oscars!"
"Actor Drama goes to Eddie Redmayne for Theory of Everything. Eddie is a charmer, who is an actor to his bones. Ditto the other 4 nominees."
McConaughey hands Actress Drama to a very excited Julianne Moore 4 Still Alice. A happy person has work and love. Congrats!
"Robert Downey Jr. gives Comedy Globe to, surprise, Grand Budapest Hotel. Funny speech from Wes Anderson, but Birdman was robbed!"
"Comedy Actor win to Michael  Keaton in Birdman. He chokes up talking about his best friend, his son Sean. How do you not love this dude?"
Actress TV Drama goes to Ruth Wilson in The Affair. Wish I could connect to that show. I can't.
Harrison Ford hands the directing Globe to Richard Linklater for Boyhood. I'm smiling.
"Newlywed George Clooney, 53, gets early DeMille Life Achievement award. A humanist. A class act. When he says ""Je Suis Charlie"" he means it."
Actor TV Series Drama goes to Kevin Spacey 4 House of Cards. He must be very happy Breaking Bad ended its run. 1st win after 8 noms.
"TV Series Drama goes The Affair when Good Wife, House of Cards, Game of Thrones and almost everything else far exceed it."
"TV Actress goes to Maggie Gyllenhaal 4  Honorable Woman, leaving Frances McDormand award-less for being the very best in Olive Kitteridge!"
"Globe 4 Foreign Film goes to Leviathan, a Russian drama I just learned is pronounced la-bee-a-thin!"
Where are the stoners &amp; drunks? The zglobes are getting as bland and self-serious as the Oscars. Where are the train wrecks?
Fonda &amp; Tomlin present TV Comedy actor to Jeffrey Tambor 4 Transparent and prove again the Globe folks know what's what when it comes to TV
"Hader &amp; Wiig, struggling with lousy material,give Screenplay Globe to Birdman and Alejandro Innaritu butchers English beautifully."
Liked Patricia Arquette's crack about getting a hug from Meryl Streep and hoping her DNA would rub off on her.
"Jared Leto gives Supporting Actress Globe to Patricia Arquette in Boyhood and her words, even from a crib sheet, hits all the right notes."
"Globe for Animated film goes to HowTo Train a Dragon 2, meaning Lego Movie didn't translate to the Hollywood Foreign Press?"
"Acerbic Ricky Gervais, bless him, gives Globe 4 Comedy to Amy Adams for Big Eyes leaving Emily Blunt to wonder how she went into the woods."
"Globe for Supporting Actor goes so deservedly to Matt Bomer in Normal Heart, a TV movie as good as anything the big screen is turning out."
"Prince, getting a standing O, gives song Globe to ""Glory"" from Selma. Good on Common &amp; John Legend. Their thank Us actually have meaning."
Globe for movie score goes to Theory of Everything when Trent Reznor &amp; Atticus Ross showed how it's really done in Gone Girl.
"Globe for TV Comedy Series goes to Transparent,a new series with guts that puts the Globes  ahead of the stodgy Emmys for cheering the new."
Globe for TV Comedy Actress goes to Gina Rodriquez for Jane the Virgin. Well deserved and first sincerely great speech of the night.
Selfie with fake North Korean journalist and Streep and Keaton falls flat. Where's Ellen when we need her?
"TV Actor Globe goes to Billy Bob Thornton for Fargo, not McConaughey or Ruffalo. Not liking the way this is going."
Globe for TV Mini goes  to Fargo instead of Normal Heart or True Detective. Bad choice.
First Brit win of the night is Joanne Froggatt  for playing Lady Mary's maid in Downton Abbey. Nice one. But no one seems drunk yet. Damn!
Supporting Actor goes as it should to JK Simmons in Whiplash. Sometimes there really is no other way to go but to the best.
"Amy and Tina R great Golden Globes hosts, especially when sticking it to Clooney and linking Sleeping Beauty to Cosby."
